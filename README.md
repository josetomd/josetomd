| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description** | A personal tracking tool for monitoring daily nutrient intake, helping users meet their dietary goals. |
| **Key Features** | Detailed meal logging and calculation of **Macronutrients** (Proteins, Fats, Carbohydrates). Daily progress indicators using visual **Progress Bars**. |
| **Storage** | Entered foods are stored locally for quick re-entry in the future. |
| **Applied Technologies** | **SwiftUI** for the UI and **Core Data** to ensure data persistence across sessions. |

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description** | An iOS application built with SwiftUI that consumes the Rick and Morty API to explore characters and their episode appearances. The project follows a clean MVVM architecture and demonstrates professional networking patterns, including dependency injection and parallel data fetching. |
| **Key Features** | Swift concurrency, (async-await, parallel fetches), clean MVVM architecture. |
| **Storage** | Real Data is stored in Core Data. Includes a secondary service layer that loads local JSON files, allowing for reliable unit testing and SwiftUI preview development without hitting the live API. |
| **Applied Technologies** | **SwiftUI** for the UI and **Core Data** to ensure data persistence across sessions. |
